The development progresses on the idea of embedding android devices into this virtual environment. This demo incorporates one more android device than <a href="http://grasia.fdi.ucm.es/sociaal/demos/2014/01/20/demoandroid.html">a previous one</a>. This time, we stream sound as well to another device situated in the bathroom. In the previous demo, sound was represented in a frame. Also, there has been improvement in the generation of image streams and in the coding of the actor's behaviors, though the later is not so visible. It will be more evident in next demos.
