The patient has at his disposal 3 devices: a smartphone, a smart TV and a smart watch. An Android remote application is installed on the smart phone to control the TV. Other Android application is installed on the smart TV that simulates the programmation on TV and offers services to channel changing and switching on/off. Both applications are implemented using JADE agents as you can see in the video.
The user is expected to use the remote to change channels and the actions are processed by the agents within.

The video shows the following sequence of actions: go to the living room, take the smart phone, sit down on the sofa, switch on tv, and make zapping.
